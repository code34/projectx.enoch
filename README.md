Survival &amp; Milsim Game - Arma3 Mod

ProjectX is a Survival Mission that takes place on Liviona at the begining of a sanitary crisis. All players play together as a special commando and have to discover what's happen in the Liviona country. Communications with HQ are broken since few days, ammos and moral are low. The population suffers from a mysterious disease (..)

Like all survival Game, ProjectX manages the thirst, the hunger, the illness, etc. You will find everything you need to stay alive on your way. With the inventory system that replaces totaly the Arma vanilla one, you interact with all the objects of the game. You could search and find stuff everywhere.
