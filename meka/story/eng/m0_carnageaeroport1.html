<p>You finally arrive on the Tarmac at Livonia airport. It seems like a few moments ago there was fighting here. You can still smell the powder in the air. Several bodies of soldiers litter the ground. Among them, you find units of your brigade. The other unknown soldiers wear uniforms from your army. The situation is incomprehensible.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What would have prompted men from your own army to engage in combat against your brigade? You remember the Bersek order, but no civilian person is here.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the end of the airport you see a huge hangar likely to contain equipment, vehicles.
