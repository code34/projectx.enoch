On this industrial site, many tanks are present and filled with a product of undetermined nature. On the sides of each tank, you can see the same reference coming back all the time: AM212.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In view of the aromas that emerge when you open the vats, you consider that this product is highly volatile, that they give off an extremely powerful, captivating, and stunning odor. Besides, the product looks quite viscous, and the light has a strange way to pass through it. </p>
<p></p>
<p>By studying each of the buildings, you deduce that you are in a sort of giant distillery. On one side of the building comes organic matter of unknown origin in the form of barrels, on the other side comes out a highly distilled and concentrated substrate stored in these tanks AM212.</p>
<p></p>
<p>AM212 could prove to be a new type of highly energetic fuel, much more efficient and stable than gasoline, hydrogen under these storage conditions. The use that is made of it elsewhere is a mystery, as is the origin of the powder which serves as its composition.</p>
