<p> Site X is a large military and scientific complex. Pre destined to close at the end of the cold war, it was finally rehabilitated to conduct scientific research in several fields (army, civilian, etc.). The main objective of this site was above all to restore the image of Livonia by making a powerful country on the march towards progress. Make the Livonioa great again! </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Since 2000, although collaussal budgetary efforts have been swallowed up in unknown research projects to the detriment of the well-being of the population, the inhabitants have resigned themselves to admitting that their country would never be a great country. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Corruption, as well as vassal states: EU, Russia, United States have pumped the coffers. Site X has by definition become a symbolic site of regime transformation. Nobody knows what's going on there. The only thing we know is that the money comes in as it disappears, that research conducted by foreign powers is being done here, not to be done elsewhere, and that it is better not to talk about it. </p>
