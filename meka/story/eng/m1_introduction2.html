<h3>What to do?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>1- You have not received radio messages for too long. Maybe we should start there?</p>
<p></p>
<p>2- Surprisingly, you haven't met anyone since your arrival. Perhaps we should contact the local population to obtain more information on the situation in the country.</p>
<p></p>
<p>* Use the radio that is in your inventory.</p>
<p>* Look for locals</p>
