<h1>Journal - Day3 - Somewhere in Liviona</h1>
<p></p>
<p>You are part of the special forces of bridle 57 which were sent in operation in Livionia. Experienced in crisis situations in hostile environments, you have been helicoptered and dropped off alone. A single watchword: do not come into contact with the local population and wait for instructions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3 days later you have not received an instruction. Hunger is pulling your stomach, and you don't have many resources left. You will have to act and perhaps contravene the orders of the command.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Damn (..) You had a nagging hunch that this mission was going to go wrong, and you were ordered to keep a low profile.</p>
