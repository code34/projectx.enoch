<p> Your radio continuously receives a carrier on all frequencies. A continuous sound which has the effect of preventing all reception. Obviously someone in the area sees an interest in jamming all frequencies. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Only local installations equipped with sufficiently large antennas and amplifiers could achieve this result. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> No instructions and plans can be carried out as long as the carrier remains in place. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> * Locate the radio antenna on your map, and disable it. </p>
