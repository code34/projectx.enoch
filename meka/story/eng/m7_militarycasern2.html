<h1> What's going on? </h1>
<p> </p>
<p> The army of Livonia seems to have deployed all of its means on the ground and has been standing for several days. The different maps show multiple contact areas. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Little flags of defeat have gradually lined the map from north to south, except for one and only one still valiant flag (the building you are in). On this scale, we can speak of extinction. The army and the population were literally wiped out. </p>
