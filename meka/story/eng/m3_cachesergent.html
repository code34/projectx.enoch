<p> The 57th sergeant was a brilliant man. He understood that the situation would be complicated and that he was going to leave his skin there. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> He therefore decided not to divulge certain information to these men so as not to compromise the smooth running of the mission. Maybe there would be no turning back. Inhabited by a glimmer of hope, he nevertheless hid the notes of the "transparency" mission in the most improbable way. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Only one man in your squad would have been able to find this cache, so he passed his notes on to you. Take a look. </p>
