<p> You slip into the building, which looks more like a lab than anything else. To go further forward, you have to go through a set of secure SAS that can only be opened gradually one after the other. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Each stage provides for the complete evacuation of the airlock and the spraying of different chemical processes to eliminate any biological risk. Fortunately, your combination is of great use to you. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> You are finally in the lab. Stunning! The modern facility has remained completely in place, and under tension. Undoubtedly this one is supplied by its own sources of energy. Still, this lab looks like a huge room for organic cultivation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Huge, secure glass bins extend over several rows and are filled with a black powder form. In this black powder, you see kinds of organism whose nature you cannot identify, moving. As they approach the ice with your hand, these organisms take on an offensive stance, as if trying to prey on you. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> The bins are overcrowded. Disturbing signals on the lab consoles are showing statistics at 150%, 170%, of containers going beyond their capacity. Obviously the cultivation continued and no one came to harvest (..) </p>
