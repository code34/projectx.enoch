<p> BK18 Research Report </p>
<p> Timofey Ilyich </p>
<p> </p>
<p> The scientific report describes precisely the protocol which was used to identify the genome of the entity, the tests carried out, as well as the results. The document also describes several processes that would have led to the reduction of the development of Z entities, and in some cases their destruction. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> One method is a BK18 liquid which could be injected intravenously or by absorption. This liquid would not be without risk either for the human organism because it would also contain some derivatives of radioactive material. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> However, in view of a sudden imminent death, a long and painful death may be less of a cure. Several vials of this BK18 liquid are still present in the building cabinets. </p>
