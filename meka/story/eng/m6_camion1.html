<p> On the outskirts of the site, a storage truck must have been hastily abandoned by site workers. The truck was left with the engine running until it broke down completely and completely. At the rear of the vehicle are stored several barrels. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> The barrels are unconventional. Each of the barrels is fitted with electromagnetic equipment which completely seals the opening. No man can have the strength to open such barrels without using the electronic keyed equipment to open it. On the cover is mentioned: bio hazard. </p>

<p> Everything suggests that these barrels contain an ultra dangerous product and that the sponsors have made every effort to ensure that no one can use them other than what they are intended for. </p>
