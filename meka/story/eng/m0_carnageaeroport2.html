<p>A civilian helicopter was parked by the army. You walk around the aircraft, and you find that it is in a condition that will not allow you to take off. Someone must have come before you and collected some coins for their personal use.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you want to make this aircraft take off again, you will have to repair it, and therefore start by finding the right parts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>* Find gears</p>
<p>* Find a candle</p>
<p>* Find a hose</p>
