<p> You cross numerous laboratories, most of which have been abandoned for months. This site is a regime shipwreck on its own. The rooms are in a dilapidated state, the floors degraded, the paint on the walls, the ceiling are crumbling. The insects colonized the place. You won't find anything really interesting here. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Things are hidden away in an isolated building. A building away seems to store a production unit. This building has been maintained. The accesses are secure and the doors / windows confined. It would be better to enter this site with a combination because everything seems to indicate that there is a real biological risk. </p>
