<p> Protocol </p>
<p> For each of our patients, we cultured several of their cells in petri dishes. What we have observed is beyond human comprehension. The cells of both patients grow in the dishes at speeds x10 greater than their normal life cycle. The cells reorganize themselves and reconstruct a new DNA code containing 58 chromosomes, until they begin to assemble a new type of very primitive and watery organism. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> We then extracted living cells from a person in the laboratory and put them in contact with these cells. The results are final. Living human cells gradually transform until they take on the appearance of a Z cell. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> The entity is therefore a physical threat, but also spreads like a virus, it can cause the death very quickly of men in contact with it, by reprogramming their DNA. </p>
